Installation:
Throne Of Bhaal is Required. Though Cassius has only SoA content 
for now, features of this mod require the presence of ToB-specific 
files for it to work.

You should obtain and install the latest TOB patch from 
www.interplay.com or www.bioware.com BEFORE installing this mod. 
Install this patch before installing any mods. 

1. Extract the contents of Cassius.rar into the BGII - SoA folder 
on your computer.

2. Double-click Setup-Cassius.exe. A console window (DOS window) 
opens up and asks whether or not you wish to install Cassius. Answer Yes.

3. You'll se a list of files being copied, and scripts and dialogue 
being compiled. This process may take a minute or two on a slower system.

4. Start a new game and enjoy!
